- [Click here to view our video](./bain-video.mp4)
    - *Note:* There is a minor typo in our video. On the slide showing results for the sentiment analysis model with the balanced/full datasets, the same precision-recall graph for the classical model appears twice by accident. This has been corrected in the slides linked above.

## Checkpoints
### [Checkpoint 0 - Proposal + KPIs + Stakeholders + Datasets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzHxnvMwwE7uKRSObFLqGNmAzjWUWJw4wVl6sMp2twQ/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Datasets (including but not limited to)
- Coursera Labeled Course Reviews https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imuhammad/course-reviews-on-coursera/data
- UW Madison Grade Distributions https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Madgrades/uw-madison-courses?select=schedules.csv  

#### KPIs
- Model can assess positive/negative sentiment better than random guessing (50/50)
- Pipeline can parse unstructured review inputs and provide overall summary of reviews (summarization, tagging)
- Allow for user input of new reviews, continuous updates of human interpretable metrics

#### Stakeholders
- Course instructors or those in “voice of customer” type roles in industry
- Administrators in academia/industry who want to produce broad performance metrics for staff
- Students/customers who may be able to assess the quality of a course or product based on review summaries
